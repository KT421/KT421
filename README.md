# Hi, I'm KT421

I'm a data analyst, I work primarily in R, and most of my projects are proprietary on our internal bitbucket. This profile contains only my schoolwork and side projects.

I turn data into actionable insights, and create automations that smooth out error-prone and tedious manual processes. I've taken a couple of data science courses (see other repos here on GitHub) but my educational background is in Linguistics (BA) and Instructional Design (MEd). My focus is on *using data to understand people*, *understanding how people use data*, and *building people's understanding of data*.

I'm gainfully employed and not entertaining offers at this time.
